These crucial rules help us ensure all our writing is readable, engaging and consistent.</p><p>If you just read one thing in our style guide it should be this. Elements of this essentials section are covered in more depth elsewhere in the guide.</p><h2>Use our name correctly</h2><p>We are “the RCVS” when referring to the organisation as a noun.</p><p class="msg msg--success">The vet nurse contacted the RCVS when they had questions about professional development.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">The vet nurse contacted RCVS when they had questions about professional development.</p><p>When using our name as an adjective, it’s RCVS.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Being thorough and methodical is a very RCVS way of doing things.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Being thorough and methodical is a very the RCVS way of doing things.</p><h2><strong>Use plain language</strong></h2><p>Always write in plain language. If possible, use words that are part of common usage – recognisable words help people understand your writing.</p><p>Use the simplest, most direct language you can and avoid jargon and cliché.</p><p>Use short sentences where possible – aim for an average sentence length of 15 to 20 words. Even when communicating complex information, try to break up long sentences. If you need to use multiple clauses in a sentence, make sure it's properly punctuated to orientate the reader.</p><p class="msg msg--success">We offer ongoing training programmes to help vets stay up-to-date on current practices.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">We advance veterinarian knowledge by promoting and facilitating continuing education through our 1CPD programme.</p><p class="msg msg--success">The student agreed to the lecturer’s request.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">The student acquiesced to the lecturer’s entreaty.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight msg--info">Paste your text into the <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hemingway Editor</a> to highlight complicated language and long sentences. Aim for a readability grade of 7-8. This will make it easier for everyone to understand your writing.</p><p>The <a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Readability Guidelines</a> are a useful resource for creating accessible content that caters for people with a range of needs.</p><h2>Avoid unnecessary capitalisation</h2><p>Lots of capital letters in our content make us comes across as overly formal and can make us seem self-important.</p><p>Limit capitalisation to proper nouns and titles.</p><p class="msg msg--success">vet</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Vet</p><p class="msg msg--highlight msg--success">animal health</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Animal Health</p><p>See <a href="https://rcvsstyleguide.netlify.app/capitalisation/">Capitalisation</a> for more detail on this.</p><h2><strong>Use the active voice</strong></h2><p>Avoid the passive voice whenever possible to make your writing more direct and straightforward.</p><p>In the active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.</p><p class="msg msg--success">RCVS plays an important role in advancing the veterinary profession.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">An important role is played by RCVS in advancing the veterinary profession.</p><p class="msg msg--success">The RCVS provided support</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Support was provided by the RCVS</p><p class="msg msg--highlight msg--info">Unsure if you’re using the passive voice? Add “by vets” to the end of your sentence. If it still makes sense, you’re using the passive voice and should consider reworking your sentence.</p><h2><strong>Use UK spelling</strong></h2><p>Use UK spelling for all your writing. If you’re unsure of a spelling, check the <a href="https://www.oed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford English Dictionary</a>.</p><p>While we use UK spelling, we take an international viewpoint and avoid assuming that people are from a particular country.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Animal welfare advocates in the UK are heading to London to meet with parliament.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Animal welfare advocates are heading to the nation's capital to meet with parliament.</p><p class="msg msg--info">Read <a href="https://rcvsstyleguide.netlify.app/grammar-and-style/">Grammar and style</a> to find out how we approach dates and times.</p><h2><strong>Use inclusive language</strong></h2><p>When writing about groups of people or individuals, be aware of political, social and cultural sensitivities around their identities. How do they want to be spoken about?</p><p>Do they describe themselves in the same way you’re describing them? If in doubt, always check with them.</p><p>Ask yourself whether the identity of the person or people you're writing about is relevant to what you're writing about. If it's not, don't mention it.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Joan says, "I love working as a vet."</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Joan, 24, says, "I love working as a vet."</p><p>Read more in <a href="https://rcvsstyleguide.netlify.app/inclusive-language/">Inclusive language</a><a href="https://rcvsstyleguide.netlify.app/inclusive-language/"></a>.</p><h2><strong>Lead with the most interesting, exciting information</strong></h2><p>When writing an article, a social media post or a web page, grab your reader's attention as soon as possible.</p><p>Include the main subject, perhaps in the form of a statement, question, statistic or story, in the title or first line. The <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inverted pyramid</a> is a useful model for this.</p><p>For readers in a rush, you're giving them the vital information. For those who want more, they know to keep reading.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Vets in private practices often complete their own research and need ethical review for their work. The Ethical Review Panel (ERP) is a subcommittee of RCVS that completes such ethical reviews for vets doing research outside of a traditional university setting.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">The Ethics Review Panel (ERP) is a subcommittee reporting to Standards Committee. The Panel's aim is to provide a mechanism for practice-based researchers, who may not normally have access to such through university or industry connections, to gain ethical review for their work.<br><br>The original trial for the Panel came about following a joint working party established by us and the British Veterinary Association, to assess the state of ethical review for practice-based research in the UK. The report of the working party indicated that an increasing amount of clinical research is being conducted by vets based in private practice who, unlike those based in veterinary schools and institutes, may not be so familiar with the regulations and best practice associated with research, particularly with reference to recognised veterinary practice and ethical review. One of the key recommendations of the report, therefore, was that we should establish a committee for ethical review of practice-based research.</p><h2>Use structured content</h2><p>Page structure helps guide users to valuable information.</p><p>Apply headings (H1s, H2s and H3s) in nested order, so that H2s are related to the H1, and H3s are related to H2s.</p><ul><li>H1 (Page topic) Introductory text</li><li>H2 (Subtopic) One idea</li><li>H3 (Subtopic of previous) One idea</li></ul><p>All headings should be in sentence case and should ideally be no more than five words.</p><h2><strong>Be concise</strong></h2><p>Don't restrict yourself with arbitrary word counts. Use as few words as you can and as many as you need to communicate the idea or make the point.</p><p>Paragraph length should be 2-3 sentences. On smaller screens, paragraphs condense considerably and walls of “grey text” may be daunting to mobile users.</p><p class="msg msg--success">RCVS is a statutory regulator that keeps the register of veterinary surgeons, sets standards for veterinary education and regulates vets’ professional conduct.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">As a statutory regulator we are responsible under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 for keeping the register of veterinary surgeons eligible to practise in the UK, setting standards for veterinary education and regulating the professional conduct of veterinary surgeons.</p><h2><strong>Write like you speak</strong></h2><p>And speak directly to your reader. This means sometimes using contractions like "you're" and "we'll." It also means using a mix of short and slightly longer sentences to add rhythm to your writing.</p><p>Writing like you speak makes our content more relatable and easier for people to connect with the words.</p><p>We talk directly to the reader as if speaking to them face-to-face, using words that are natural in conversation.</p><p class="msg msg--success">To make sure we achieve our goal…</p><p class="msg msg--warning">To ensure a successful outcome…</p><p class="msg msg--info">Read your text aloud to see if it sounds robotic, corporate or floral. If it doesn’t sound natural and easy to understand, try reworking it by saying: “What I mean is….” then writing down your verbal explanation. (This tactic can also help you to spot errors.)</p><h2><strong>Don't tell people how to feel</strong></h2><p>Our audience comes from diverse backgrounds and people experience life in different ways. Don't make assumptions about how people may feel about events and situations.</p><p>Sweeping statements can have an unintended impact, leaving readers feeling isolated, patronised, upset or as though they don't belong.</p><p class="msg msg--success">We understand the topic of animal mistreatment can be troubling for some.</p><p class="msg msg--warning">We know how distressed you must feel about the mistreatment of animals.</p><h2><strong>Use the RCVS voice</strong></h2><p>Our voice is compassionate, confident and calm.</p><p>You can find examples of what this looks like in practice in <a href="https://rcvsstyleguide.netlify.app/voice-and-tone/">Voice and tone</a>.</p><h2><strong>Be precise and correct</strong></h2><p>If you're not 100% sure about a statement you've made, check the facts and include references whenever relevant. If you're including a reference or source in web content, be sure to use an inline link rather than a footnote.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight msg--info">Even the best writers make mistakes.
